  - Booking completion indicator (1/0)

## Methods 
- Data cleaning and preprocessing 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Hypothesis testing (Chi-Square Test & Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) 
- Logistic regression analysis to study how customer preferences and trip characteristics are associated with booking completion and how trip characteristics are associated with preference selection outcomes

## Key Findings
- Some trip characteristics showed significant associations with customer preference selections
- Customer preferences exhibited statistically meaningful relationships with booking completion likelihood
- Results highlight how customer behavior and trip characteristics influence booking outcomes

## Tools
